                    <h5 className="step">Creating a gaming website using React.js involves building a front-end user interface and integrating it with a backend to manage data. Here are some basic tips  on how to do it:</h5>
                    <h3 className="mt-4 up">1. Set Up Your Development Environment:</h3>
                    <ul className="mar">
                        <li>Ensure you have the Node.js package install that is used to edit your code and npm installed on your system.</li>
                        <li>Create a new React project using Create React App (npm install new-react-app). </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 className="mt-4 up">2. Create necessary components:</h3>
                    <ul className="mar">
                        <li>Identify the components you need for your game website, such as header, footer, sidebar, and individual game post components.</li>
                        <li>Create React components for each part of your website. For example:</li>
                        <li>'Header.js'</li>
                        <li>'Footer.js'</li>
                        <li>'Sidebar.js'</li>
                        <li>'GamePost.js'</li>
                        <li>'GameList.js' (to display a list of game posts)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 className="mt-4 up">3. Set up routing:</h3>
                    <ul className="mar">
                        <li>Install React Router (npm install react-router-dom)</li>
                        <li>Define routes for different pages of your game website, such as the homepage, individual game posts, and category pages.</li>
                        <li>Set up navigation links and use the Link component provided by React Router to navigate between pages.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 className="mt-4 up">4. Manage state:</h3>
                    <ul className="mar">
                        <li>Decide how you want to manage the state in your application. You can use React's built-in state management or libraries like Redux or Context API.</li>
                        <li>Define the state variables you need, such as the list of game posts or the currently selected category.</li>
                        <li>Update the state as needed, for example, when fetching data from an API or when the user interacts with the website.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 className="mt-4 up">5. Fetch data:</h3>
                    <ul className="mar">
                        <li>Decide where you'll be storing your game post data. It could be in a JSON file, a database, or fetched from an external API.</li>
                        <li>Use 'fetch' or a library like Axios to retrieve game post data from your data source.</li>
                        <li>Update the state with the fetched data and pass it down to the appropriate components as props.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div className="col-12 mb-5">
                    <video className="second" src="./videos/hacks.mp4" controls={true} width="100%" />
                </div>
                <div className="second col-12 my-5 first">
                    <h3 className="mt-4 up">6. Create the game layout and design:</h3>
                    <ul className="mar">
                        <li>Use CSS (or a preprocessor like Sass) to style your components and create a visually appealing layout for your game website.</li>
                        <li>Ensure your website is responsive and works well on different screen sizes and devices.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 className="mt-4 up">7. Add features and functionality:</h3>
                    <ul className="mar">
                        <li>Implement features like pagination, search functionality, and category filtering based on your requirements.</li>
                        <li>Add functionality for users to create accounts, log in, and leave comments on game posts if necessary.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 className="mt-4 up">8. Testing and optimization:</h3>
                    <ul className="mar">
                        <li>Test your game website thoroughly to ensure it works as expected and is bugs-free.</li>
                        <li>Optimize the performance of your website by minimizing the bundle size, optimizing images, and improving loading times.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 className="mt-4 up">9. Deploy your game website:</h3>
                    <ul className="mar">
                        <li>Once you're satisfied with your game website, deploy it to a hosting platform like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 className="mt-4 up">10. Maintenance and updates:</h3>
                    <ul className="mar">
                        <li>Regularly update your game website with new content and features.</li>
                        <li>Monitor performance and user feedback, and make improvements as needed.</li>
